    Build a Pure-Django-API 
    
    Step 1: Set up the virtual environment
            First create a Directory (In our case it's Rest-API-with-Python)
            Open terminal in that directory
            Run following command in terminal:-
            >>virtualenv -p python3 .
            
            Activate this Virtual Environment
            >>source bin/activate
     Step 2: Install neccesary Packages using PIP
            Django
            >>pip install django
            
     Step 3: Make new directory src
	     Change directory to src

            Create a django project 
            >>django-admin startproject cfeapi
            
	     Change directory to Project Folder
            >>cd cfeapi

            Migrate models to dbms
            >>python manage.py migrate

            Create a superuser to access the data
            >>python manage.py createsuperuser

            Run created project to check
            >>python manage.py runserver

     Step 4: Create an app to handle CRUD operations
            >>python manage.py startapp updates

            Once we have created our app, we can create models
            Open updates/models.py and create your models

            Create a model called update,
            Which cotains user,Image,Content,Timeline

            Add our app to Installed App in Settings.py
            Register the app in admin.py


            Make migrations to convert given model to equivalent Database tables
            >>python manage.py makemigrations
            >>python manage.py migrate

     
     Step 5: Create Views(API) for returning the JSON file as Response
              create a function which accepts a request and returns http response or Json Response
              
              Open urls.py
              Import views in this file
              In urls.py -> path add this view

              Now lets convert this view into a class based view
              To begin with that from django.views.generic import View

              Make a class inheriting from View class
              Add a method called get
